**Machine Learning Project | Fake News Detector :**

_Using natural language processing and Naive Bayes, this project will analyze a dataset of news articles that have been labeled as ‘unreliable’ or ‘reliable’ and build a model to predict reliability._

_The website will, in addition to describing the methodologies, utilize WordCloud to visualize the words used in determined ‘unreliable’ articles to see which topics are common targets of ‘unreliable news’. Related pairs of words can also be used in scatterplots to show relationships between frequencies and the division between determined ‘reliable’ and ‘unreliable’ articles in the dataset._
